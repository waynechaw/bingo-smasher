  <h1>What is a bingo?</h1>

  <p>
    Good question! Being "bingoed" refers to the common phrases one may hear from people when they tell others they do not want kids. Imagine it like a Bingo Board, covered in phrases such as "You'll change your mind one day", "you're so selfish for not wanting kids", or "It's different when it's your own!".

  <h1>What does it mean to be "childfree"?</h1>

  <p>
    While some people choose to elaborate on their definitions, on the most basic level, a childfree person is someone who does not wish to parent a child, blood-related or adopted, at any point in their life. There may be many reasons, ranging from financial, environmental, or just simply a simple "I don't want children".
